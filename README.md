# learning_group_theory
All my learning about abstract algebra, ring theory, field theory, lattice theory, module theory, category theory, Galois theory, homology, homotopy, univalent foundations, HoTT and K theory.

# Concepts - group theory

**groupoid** - a set with some operations (usually inverse) and closed under itself

**semigroup** - an associative groupoid

**monoid** - a semigroup with an identity

**group** - a monoid with inverses

**abelian group** - a commutative group

**coset** - a modification of a group/subgroup

**left-coset** - a coset with a left-side operation for non-abelian groups

**right-coset** - a coset with a right-side operation for non-abelian groups

**normal subgroup** - a subgroup such that all left cosets are identicals to the same right coset

**trivial subgroup** - the only 2 immutable subgroups of a group -- itself and its identity

**nontrivial subgroup** - the same as subgroups, except itself and its identity

**quotient/factor group** - the set/group of all cosets

**congruence class** - a quotient group which you add two elements of distinct sets and gets another set

**cyclic group** - a group that has a generator (i.e, it's generated by a single element)

**homomorphism** - convert a group into another group

**isomorphism** - a homomorphism that is bijective

**kernel** - a function between homomorphisms that collects all the elements in the 1st set that results in identity on the 2nd set

**order of element** - is denoted by `|x| = n`, where `x^n = 0`identity)

**order of group** - the number of elements that is contained within the group

**symmetric/permutation group** - a group `Sn` where `n` is the order of the group and can be rearranged in `n!` ways, and has a function that allows you to choose an element by its position

**dihedral group** - a permutation group of regular polygons where the notation `D^n` is the number of sides and `D^2n` is the number of symmetries and is cyclic under rotations and flips

**simple group** - a group with only two subgroups -- itself and its identity

# Concepts - ring theory

**ring** - an abelian group with multiplication

**zero divisor** - some multiplicative operation that is out of range and points to identity

**unit ring** - a ring with some 1-like behaviour for multiplication

**integral domain** - a unit ring with no zero divisors

**matrix group** - a group of matrices over a field with scalar multiplication

**ideal** - a subset that still is closed under itself. e.g: set of even numbers, since all addition, subtraction and multiplication of even numbers results in another even number

**vector space** - the set of vectors

# Concepts - field theory
**field** - a ring with a multiplication inverse (division)

# Concepts - module theory
**module** - a generalized vector space, that has a ring of scalars (and therefore it no longer reqyures multiplication inverse)

# Theorems
**Lagrange's theorem** - says that the possibilities of subgroups is the number of all the divisors of the number of elements of the main group
